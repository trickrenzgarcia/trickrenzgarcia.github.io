    <h1>My High School Life</h1>

    I've done so much fun on my highschool days, when I was grade 7 at Caloocan Highschool the unforgettable moments, I made alot of friends 
    Me and the Boys always skipping the Class whenever we don't wan't to learn with that teacher, for me back then, I don't think that was 
    a wrong decision because on that time Grade doesn't matter to me, so I always got line of 7 lol.<p>
