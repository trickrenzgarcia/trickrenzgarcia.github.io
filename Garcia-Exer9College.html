    <h1>My College Life</h1>

    here in college I take BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) because this path is for me, 
    to be Game developer I dream when I was a little because I played computer games, When I was on Senior Highschool I start learn programming 
    BSIT is not my first love, it was Computer Science. but since it is pandemic I choose my 2nd option for now.
    Major subject is not a problem to me but the minor subject is, because Im suck at english, communication, grammar and sometimes in math.<p>
